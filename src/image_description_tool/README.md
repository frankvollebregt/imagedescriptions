# The Image Description Tool
This folder can be statically hosted on a website like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It reads data from the `data.json` file, and displays it in the tool. The user can perform each task, and after the final task is complete they will be sent to a page to download or copy their results.

If images without a public URL are used, the images themselves should be included in this folder as well.
